                <p>My name is Libby Francis, I live in Gilbert, AZ. My husband and I have been married for 23 years and have four kids, ranging from 16-22. I love spending time with my family, even when we are annoyed with each other. I love learning anything I can learn. I enjoy and practice drawing, coloring, ceramics, and painting. I also love all things medical, specifically cardiology. Life for me is not always enjoyable but it is worth the time I have spent exploring it. I was born in Ohio and lived there the first six years of my life. My family then moved to Douglasville, GA and lived there for four years. In 1989 we moved to Parker, CO, where I lived until I was 17yrs old when I moved with my oldest sister to an apartment in Denver, CO, where eventually I met my husband. We got sealed Aug 2000 in the Manti Utah Temple, but lived in Denver until January 2001 when we moved down to Mesa, AZ.</p>

                <p>Arizona is hot and dry most of the year. The beauty is hard to find but after rain it is picturesque.</p>
